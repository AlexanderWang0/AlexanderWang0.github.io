Meetings: 5 hours<br>
Adding features: 7 hours<br>
Debugging: 1 hour<br>
<p>I was unfortunately not able to do as much as I wanted in the past two weeks, because I did a project and a surprisingly difficult homework assignment for a class. I was a programmer in the narrative and encounter squad, so most of my studio work was implementing dialog boxes. Before I started working, someone else (most likely Nikhil) already created a narrative scene, a dialog box, and a NarrativeDisplay script with many of the features we wanted. In the first week, I attached that dialog box to the main UI prefab and tried to get it to work properly in the combat scene. I got it to display text and pause the game. When the player clicks a continue button, the dialog box hides itself and unpauses the game.</p>
<p>The dialog box and cutscenes both used the NarrativeDisplay script, NarrativeDisplay paused the game whenever it was active, and there was a cutscene that used time to animate itself, so the game softlocked whenever it tried to play the cutscene. In the second week, I fixed this bug by adding a separate cutscene state in the game manager, and unpausing the game whenever it was in the new cutscene state. My biggest new feature was allowing a scene to display multiple lines of dialog. Each scene's dialog is stored in an instance of CombatEncounterSO. NarrativeDisplay can read dialog from any CombatEncounterSO instance, and it displays the next line when the player clicks on the dialog box. The fight starts when the player clicks the box and it's displaying the last line. Additionally, I attended two of the narrative writing calls. Listening to other people's ideas was interesting, but I did not contribute very much.</p>

Meetings: 4 hours<br>
Adding features: 10 hours<br>
Debugging: 3 hours<br>
<p>Near the beginning of the week, I tested the game and reported at least 6 bugs. I spent the bugfixing week implementing an animated arrow for the dialog boxes, because I already fixed all the reported dialog-related bugs in the previous week. The arrow took surprisingly long because I was unfamiliar with the Unity animator, and most of the tutorials were focused on sprites while I wanted to animate an UI image. I also went to both work sessions and spent roughly 2 hours helping another programmer change projectile mechanics. The projectile code I wrote over the summer was very messy and difficult to read.</p>
<p>In the second week, all my tasks were related to adding new enemy submarine encounters into the game. This mostly involved making copies of the already-existing prefab, making copies of the rooms in the submarine, changing the positions and systems in the rooms, and spawning crew members in the rooms. This went a lot more smoothly than I expected, but I did run into a few problems. First, the designers told me to use weapons that aren't in the game yet, so I left those rooms empty for now. There was also an issue where the GameManager instantiated both the default enemy submarine and my new submarine in every scene. I don't know exactly how the room ScriptableObjects work, so it's possible that hitting one room on the enemy will damage systems or crew members in rooms with the same system as the room that was hit. I have not properly tested this.</p>
